# Sales Dashboard Project Using Power BI

Overview
In this project, I developed an interactive sales dashboard using Power BI to visualize and analyze sales data. The objective was to provide actionable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and market trends to support decision-making.

Data Collection and Preparation

Data Sources: Collected sales data from multiple sources, including Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, and a SQL Server database.
Data Cleaning: Cleaned the data to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure consistency and accuracy.
Data Transformation: Used Power Query Editor in Power BI to transform the data, including merging tables, creating calculated columns, and setting data types.
Tools and Features

Power Query: Utilized for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Created custom measures and calculated columns to enhance the analysis.
Power BI Visuals: Leveraged various Power BI visualizations like bar charts, line charts, pie charts, maps, and tables.
Power BI Service: Published the dashboard to the Power BI Service for sharing and collaboration.

Analysis and Visualization

Sales Performance: Visualized total sales, sales by product category, and sales by region to identify top-performing products and regions.
Time Series Analysis: Created line charts to show sales trends over time, including monthly and yearly comparisons.
Customer Analysis: Analyzed customer demographics and purchase behavior, including new vs. returning customers and average purchase value
Profitability: Calculated profit margins and visualized profitability by product and region.

Key Features

Interactive Filters: Implemented slicers and filters to allow users to drill down into specific data, such as selecting a particular region, product category, or time period.
Dynamic Reports: Created dynamic and interactive reports that update automatically with new data.
KPIs: Included key performance indicators (KPIs) to track critical metrics like total sales, average order value, and profit margins.

Key Findings

Top Products and Regions: Identified the best-selling products and regions contributing most to the sales.
Sales Trends: Recognized seasonal sales trends and peak sales periods, which informed inventory and marketing strategies.
Customer Insights: Gained insights into customer purchasing patterns, helping to tailor marketing efforts and improve customer retention.
Profit Analysis: Highlighted the most profitable products and regions, guiding strategic decisions on product offerings and market focus.

Conclusion
The Power BI sales dashboard provided a comprehensive view of the sales data, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. The interactive and dynamic nature of the dashboard facilitated deeper insights and better understanding of sales performance and market trends.
